# AI-Powered Personalized Learning Assistant

This project was developed as part of the *AI and Business* course at Simon Business School.  
It demonstrates how **Generative AI** can automate content creation and personalize user experiences using **GPT-4**, **Python**, and **Google Sheets API**.

---

## Objective
To build an AI system that generates **personalized weekly learning plans** based on user data (age, grade, interests, and challenges), adapts through feedback, and saves time for educators.

---

## Key Features
- **Generative AI (GPT-4)** for dynamic learning plan creation  
- **Prompt engineering** for structured and contextual responses  
- **Feedback loop** that refines plans based on user input  
- **Google Sheets API integration** for real-time data access  
- **Python-based prototype** for automation and scalability  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API**
- **Google Sheets API**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, gspread, openai, dotenv**

---

## How It Works
1. Fetches student profile data from Google Sheets  
2. Uses GPT-4 to generate a customized weekly plan  
3. Accepts feedback to improve future outputs  
4. Displays the final plan with recommended topics and activities  

---

## Value
- Automates manual planning tasks  
- Enhances personalization and engagement  
- Demonstrates how **LLMs** can be applied to real business problems  
- Framework adaptable to **customer personalization**, **sales enablement**, or **workflow automation**
